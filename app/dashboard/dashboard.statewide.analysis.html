  <h3>Statewide Analysis</h3>
  <p>In this section you will find some visualisations on the Statewide dataset.</p>
  <p>Each graph aims to give you a new way to look at the data, whether it be as a time series for all activities, accumulated features for an activity or other.</p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h3>Statewide activities over time</h3>
  <br />
  <br />
  <total-each-activity-timeline-graph
    color="orange"
    datarrr="surveysSplitByActivityTimeline"
  ></total-each-activity-timeline-graph>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h3>Statewide individual activity totals</h3>
  <br />
  <br />
  <total-each-activity-graph

    datarrr="surveysSplitByActivity"
    boogie="bogus"
  ></total-each-activity-graph>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h3>Statewide activity conversions</h3>
  <p>Using the total number of attempts for an activity, split it up into what percentage of attempts resulted in i) Answers ii) Meaningful Interactions.</p>
  <p>For example, to find the most efficient activity (in terms of total attempts made) for generating meaningful interactions (MI): look for the activity which has the tallest bar for MI, i.e. from the base of MI to the top of the MI bar.</p>
  <p>This only applies for activities for which we measure total attempts, total answered and total meaningful interactions. That means for this graph there will only ever be these activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Door Knocking</li>
    <li>Phone Banking</li>
    <li>Volunteer Recriutment Phone Calling</li>
    <li>One On One</li>
    <li>Stall</li>
  </ul>
  <br />

  ></activity-conversions-graph>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h3>Statewide total volunteer works hours spent</h3>
  <p>This only applies for activities for which we measure total volunteer work hourse. That means for this graph there will only ever be these activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Door Knocking</li>
    <li>Phone Banking</li>
    <li>Volunteer Recriutment Phone Calling</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
