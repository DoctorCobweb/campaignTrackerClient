  <h3>{{region}} Analysis</h3>
  <p>In this section you will find some visualisations on the region dataset.</p>
  <p>Each graph aims to give you a new way to look at the data, whether it be as a time series for all activities, accumulated features for an activity or other.</p>
  <br />
  <br />

  <h3>{{region}} weekly door knocking meaningful interactions</h3>
  <p>The X axis is the number of weeks away from the election day, 29 Nov 2014.</p>

  <br />

  <h3>{{region}} activity conversions</h3>
  <p>Using the total number of attempts for an activity, split it up into what percentage of attempts resulted in i) Answers ii) Meaningful Interactions.</p>
  <p>For example, to find the most efficient activity (in terms of total attempts made) for generating meaningful interactions (MI): look for the activity which has the tallest bar for MI, i.e. from the MI base to the MI top.</p>
  <p>This only applies for activities for which we measure total attempts, total answered and total meaningful interactions. That means for this graph there will only ever be these activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Door Knocking</li>
    <li>Phone Banking</li>
    <li>Volunteer Recriutment Phone Calling</li>
    <li>One On One</li>
    <li>Stall</li>
  </ul>
  <br />

  <h3>{{region}} total volunteer works hours spent</h3>
  <p>This only applies for activities for which we measure total volunteer work hourse. Th
at means for this graph there will only ever be these activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Door Knocking</li>
    <li>Phone Banking</li>
    <li>Volunteer Recriutment Phone Calling</li>
  </ul>
