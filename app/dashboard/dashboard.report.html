<div class="col-md-12">
  This is the report view.
  <p>TODO:</p>
  <p>-implement pdf/csv/xlsx creation for desired scope of report e.g. for a region.</p>
  <p>-implement charts using d3js (implies probably have to generate a pdf style report).</p>
  <p>-if using pdf must create custom buildpack to include, say, cairo.</p>
